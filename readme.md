# project bank (php) #

You must create an application that allows the user to create and manage bank accounts.
The basic features (therefore mandatory) are simple:
- Create a new bank account (with at least one id, a name and a default sum)
- View accounts
- Delete an account
- Make payments on the accounts (via a form)
- Make withdrawals
- Make transfers from one account to another.
